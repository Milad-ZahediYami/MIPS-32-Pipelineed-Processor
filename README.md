# MIPS-32-Pipelineed-Processor
This is the implementation of 5-stage pipeline, 32 bit MIPS architecture processor. This project gives a broad view of the MIPS architecture, including instruction-set, memory-model and interrupts.

In the first phase of this project, we have implemented the fetch and decode stages which read 32 bit memomry instructions from read.txt file. Phase I continues with decoding process of instructions.

In the second phase, we have designed and implemented the whole MIPS architecture with all details.
